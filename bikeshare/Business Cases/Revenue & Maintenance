Business Case: The "Revenue & Maintenance" Strategy
Client: EcoCycle Solutions Board of Directors.
Problem: Unpredictable daily operational costs. Large repair bills often hit during peak months because the maintenance team is overwhelmed when bike usage spikes.
Goal: Build a Daily Demand Forecaster to predict total rentals per day. This allows the business to:
Schedule Preventive Maintenance: Fix bikes on predicted "Low Demand" days before the "High Demand" days break them.
Financial Budgeting: Forecast revenue to ensure they have enough cash for parts and new bike orders for the 2025-2026 expansion.
Step-by-Step ML Workflow (Strategic Tier)
Macro-Data Ingestion
Load day.csv.
Focus: Since this is 2025, we check for Monthly Seasonality. We want to see how "Season 4" (Winter) in 2011 compares to "Season 4" in 2012 to account for business growth.
Feature Engineering (Macro-Trends)
Rolling Averages: Create a "7-day rolling average" of temperature. One hot day doesn't change behavior, but a heatwave (3+ hot days) significantly lowers demand.
Lag Features: Create a 1-day lag (yesterday's count) and a 7-day lag (same day last week).
Target Analysis (The "Segment" Split)
Instead of just predicting total_rentals, we will look at Casual vs. Registered users.
Strategy: If a day is a holiday with good weather, casual users spike (high wear-and-tear). If it’s a workingday, registered users dominate (predictable, stable income).
Model Selection (Stability over Speed)
Use a Ridge Regressor or Random Forest.
Why: For daily data, we only have ~730 rows. High-complexity models like XGBoost might "overfit" (memorize the noise) on such small data. We need a stable model that generalizes well.
Evaluation (Financial Alignment)
Calculate Profit/Loss Impact. If the model predicts 4,000 bikes but only 3,500 are used, we calculate the cost of "over-staffing" for that day.
Operationalization (The Executive Dashboard)
Unlike the Hourly Dashboard for truck drivers, this dashboard is for the Manager. It shows a 7-day calendar view with "Maintenance Green Zones" (low demand days perfect for repairs).
